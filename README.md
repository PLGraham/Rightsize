# ‘Rightsize’: a metagame method for testing adjustability in multi-apartment housing

4th August 2024

In a new paper for the journal, *Buildings and Cities*, Graham *et al* [(2024)](https://journal-buildingscities.org/collections/energy-sufficiency) introduce a sufficiency-oriented approach to the design of new housing. This aims to help people in multi-apartment housing respond to changing housing needs by merging an apartment they might own with adjacent modules of living space they could rent. The element of ongoing rental costs encourage the shedding of underused space, thereby helping to address the problem that in the UK, a chronic misallocation of housing space means some people do not have enough space, whilst others use excess energy to heat and cool unoccupied rooms. Converting this theoretical basis into a conceptual framework, the paper proposes a metagame (or context-adaptable blueprint) through which to test the spatial and energy sufficiency of certain housing layouts. A beta version of this design game suggests this method has the potential to reveal strategic behaviours, produce a shared understanding of sufficiency, help to overcome institutional barriers to sufficiency-focused new-build housing, and produce qualitative (and potentially quantitative) data for further analysis. This GitHub repository has been set up as an invitation to the gaming community to develop the proposition into a workable 2D or even 3D tile-based or digital gaming environment that could be made accessible to diverse stakeholders in the fields of design, development and real estate investment.

1. ### A conceptual framework for adjustable housing

   The key functions of an adjustable housing system can be described through a conceptual framework diagram (Figure 1\) and was the basis upon which the design game was built. This helps to explain how different inputs of connectable, mixed tenure apartments with certain sizes and rights over shared amenities *(independent variables)* might produce variations in spatial and energy sufficiency outputs *(dependent variables)*. The *state variables* describe mediating and moderating factors that shape this relationship. These are: life stage events (whose probability changes with age of household head[^1]); configuration of tenure (e.g. all rented, all owned or alternating); occupancy (i.e. household size); the availability of shared amenities (e.g. garden, storage, guest rooms, etc); and lastly, the degree of freedom that residents have to change the input (independent variables) to meet their emerging needs. Deciding these are of course the residents, whose choices and interactions may be thought of as *confounding variables*, being difficult to predict.

   The *control variables* indicate a need to compare an adjustable arrangement to a standardised and inflexible volume housebuilder (VHB) model, as is typically designed to maximise short-term profitability rather than longer-term social or environmental value [(Samuel, 2023, pp. 38–39)](https://paperpile.com/c/BPSyQj/evA1/?locator=38-39). To explore these variables, the game can be configured as an adjustable housing scheme or as caricature of mass-market housing, complete with fixed dwelling sizes of a single tenure and no shared amenities. Observable differences in the frequency of house moves or the aggregate consumption of housing space can expose relationships that occur at a local level (i.e. a single estate or housing development) but which are typically buried in data on housing needs or affordability that reveal only the macro picture.

A closer examination of the *state variables* helps to explain why adjustability affects spatial sufficiency. For example, tenure configuration is important because any modules of living space that a homeowner connects to and *rents*, will create a monthly liability and therefore an incentive to ‘rightsize’. Meanwhile, rights over shared amenities are important because they enable spillovers from private dwellings into semi-private space. Design control is important because an input arrangement in which tenure and/or fixed dwelling sizes are laid out in an alternating pattern across a scheme is likely to produce a different output from one that is arranged more organically or by the residents themselves. In these regards, the design game approach offers insights into certain *non-spatial* aspects of multi-dwelling living that nevertheless affect spatial and energy sufficiency. Amongst these are insights to the spatial impact of bottom-up decision-making and fully mixed tenure arrangements, as opposed to the sorts of top-down management and core-by-core separation of tenure that is known to cause distrust of housing associations amongst tenants.

2. ### How to play *‘Rightsize’*: game operation and notation

   The aim of the design game, *‘Rightsize’*, is for players to maintain a sufficient amount of living space so that present and anticipated housing needs are accommodated without wasting space or causing overcrowding. At each turn, players \- acting as residents \- have to add or release housing space to absorb changing life stage events, whilst other, competing players attempt to do similar in the same apartment development. The rules (or notation) illustrated in Figure 2 explain how both the game and an adjustable housing scheme might work in practice. 

   ![][image2]

  >_**Figure 2:** This diagrammatic overview of the design game builds on the conceptual framework in Figure 1\. Hence, the input is equivalent to the independent variables, the process to state variables, interventions are confounding variables and the output is where dependent variables are captured by the scoring system._

   The housing or game environment is made up of square or hexagonal tiles depicting modules of housing space and shared amenities that can be occupied. Readers with experience of the tile-based game, [*Carcassonne*](https://wikicarpedia.com/car/Base\_game)*,* or the [*Settlers of Catan*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan)*,* will recognise the concept of 2D tiles that represent space that can be occupied by figures. Importantly, however, the environment created in the design game, *Rightsize,* includes all three domains that make up the adjustable housing concept (Figure 3). Hence, there are units of private living space that can be divided and joined (‘adjustable dwellings’), tenure arrangements to incentivise rightsizing (‘adjustable equity’), and shared amenities for absorbing spillover from private dwellings (‘adjustable infrastructure’).

![][image3]  

  >_**Figure 3:** Adjustable housing combines (from L to R), joinable/divisible dwellings that can be connected vertically as well as horizontally; alternating tenures to encourage downsizing; and, shared infrastructure for spill over (e.g. shared outdoor spaces and amenities such as storage and guest rooms)._

  Players begin by constructing the housing environment, taking turns to draw housing tiles, of which there are three types. Initially these are *amenity tiles*, depicting landscape and ground level amenities in and around the scheme (e.g. bike shed, project space, guest room, storage, gardens, laundry, vegetable growing). Thereafter, they draw *dwelling tiles* depicting connectable living spaces and separating walls and floors (Figure 3). Lastly, they draw *edge tiles* depicting rooftop, sky or surrounding foliage. Placed edge-to-edge, the tiles resemble an axonometric section through an apartment building (Figure 5). One function of the amenity and edge tiles is to graphically orientate the emerging apartment development. 

***![][image4]***

  >_**Figure 4:** Hexagonal ‘dwelling tiles’ have three basic types. Grey denotes living space, yellow is walls, and white dashed lines are connectable ‘soft panels’ through which living spaces may be joined (indicated by arrows)._

![][image5]

  >_**Figure 5:** In this illustration of dwelling tiles only, the coloured outlines indicate living spaces’ that players may claim: Solid red diamond denotes a main living area (of which one per complete apartment); blue denotes spaces allocated to a possible stair connection); and, the remaining spaces (edged in red dashed lines) are bedrooms. The arrows indicate possible connections through ‘soft panels’)._

  Each player has a set of pieces of matching colour. These comprise placeholders (discs), ‘dependents’ (figures), stairs (matchsticks) and 8-sided dice. At each turn, these four piece types may be used to ‘claim’ amenity or living spaces on any amenity or dwelling tile they place. They do this by either ‘occupying’ the space (using a dependent); by connecting two vertical spaces (using a stair); and/or by ‘buying’ the space (using an 8-sided dice or placeholder). One amenity tile may be placed per turn \- akin to the [river pieces](https://wikicarpedia.com/car/River) in Carcassonne \- whereas extra dwelling tiles may be placed in a single turn until the player has fully accommodated their required household size. 

  Upon drawing a dwelling tile, a turn comprises six steps: (1) The household size is ‘discovered’ by rolling a six-sided dice; (2) An 8-sided dice is rolled to decide the age group[^2] of the head of the household to be accommodated in that turn; (3) The same 8-sided dice is used to represent the head of household and is placed (with the number rolled facing up) on a living space, thereby indicating that this will be the *main* living space (notionally 40m2 for 1-person); (4) The player then continues to draw and occupy living spaces on dwelling tiles using ‘dependent’ pieces (one per living space), on the basis that each space represents a further 10m2 bedroom; (5) If so desired, a player may continue to draw tiles and ‘buy’ extra spaces as contingency, but using placeholders rather than dependents; (6) The turn ends when the player decides they have occupied *sufficient* housing space to accommodate the required household size, with *sufficient* margin for anticipated changes or future needs. Once the turn is complete, the next player takes over until either their 8-sided dice are used up, or the dwelling tiles are used up.

  >_**Figure 6:** This illustration shows a 3-person household with a spare room, with a head of household age 60-69, occupying the main living space (solid red line). The thinner, horizontal arrow indicates a notional horizontal connection through a party wall._

  Each subsequent round of *Rightsize* represents a decade, during which players take turns to: (1) Advance the age of their household head (up to a plausible ceiling, say 100); (2) Draw a lifestage event chance card (where probabilities vary by age so that the risk of bereavement and pregnancy, say, move in opposite directions); and, (3) Attempt to accommodate the required lifestage changes by adding or removing new dependents (or placeholders as contingency). If no vertically or horizontally adjacent living spaces are available \- and there are no suitable amenities for spillover (storage, gardens, guest rooms, etc) \- then expanding households have to double-up dependents and lose points for overcrowding. Conversely, if shrinking households hold excess space as contingency, they lose points for under-occupancy. The game can end after any round and the winner is the player with the least penalty points. 

3. ### Findings from the beta version

   To date, the development of *Rightsize* has taken the game through multiple iterations. Initially these concerned drawing projection, which started with a 2D, plan-based environment made of *Post-it* notes, before moving to an exploded axonometric with the same plans at 45 degrees. These versions had the benefit of showing deck walkways and paired bedrooms between main living spaces, thereby enhancing the range of available spatial outcomes (Figure 6). Ultimately, however, a plan view did not lend itself to vertical stair connections, nor could it show the all-important party wall connections except in 2D. For these reasons its usefulness and legibility were limited, although a future, 3D physical or digital version might revert to this format.

   ![][image7]

  >_**Figure 7:** The diagrammatic plan (above) shows that when pairs of connectable bedrooms are placed between main living spaces, they can combine to produce a more useful range of space-standards-compliant configurations (accepting that in reality, risers stairs and other practicalities would disrupt this simplified diagram)._

   During beta testing (Figure 7), it transpired that whilst hexagonal tiles help to turn a 2D tabletop game into a 3D axonometric projection, graphic improvements are now needed to aid legibility. The recommendation to introduce amenity and edge tiles could significantly enhance legibility by framing the main dwelling environment (akin to the game, *Settlers of Catan)*. Ultimately, however, it will require more illustrative tiles (akin to the tiles in *Carcassonne*) to make the apartments ‘pop out’. This could be helped further by making the coloured playing pieces represent furnishings. These modifications would be especially helpful for players who are less familiar with architectural drawings. The development of *Rightsize* has also included some simplification of the rules and pieces. Much of this has come from the process of explaining the notation in this paper, and some from an emphasis on narrative over nuance, to turn the game into an explainer of adjustable housing. For similar reasons, an element of fun will make the game accessible to wider audiences, whilst a degree of exaggeration of the lifestage events will help to emphasise the issues around the production and function of housing that *Rightsize* tries to raise.

   During testing, several variations or future ‘extensions’ to *Rightsize* emerged. These are discussed in the main journal paper. Recent work has focussed on testing some floor plans that are known to be adjustable. This is with a view to using the method to test new housing schemes for adjustability before the developer is fully committed to the structural design or tenure mix. This process has entailed significant simplification from the hexagonal tile into square tiles to depict one floor plan at a time. and will be illustrated in the next update to this file. Willing collaborators to this ongoing development process are invited to make suggestions within this file and / or upload their own graphic and diagrammatic suggestions for a game that responds to the conceptual proposition described here and in the main journal paper.
